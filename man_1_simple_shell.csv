.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
- [command][argurments]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a simplistic implementation of the Unix Shell commands. It can be executed with the <./hsh> command. ./hsh 
is a custom-made command line interpreter that reads and executes basic commands from user input exactly as
any standar unix-like operating systems shell program would.

.PP
.SH USAGE
This simple shell accepts user commands from standard input. The command is passed to the shell
when the user presses the enter key.  This simple shell is capable of performing the following actions:

Tokennizes command line string into null terminated array.

Searches for exact path of command if the exact path is not given by user.

Executes the command passed by user.

If the command or path are not found, the program returns error message.

.SH BUILTINS

.SB
.IP cd
-   Changes the current directory of the process.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After a command is read by the interpreter, it will be split into tokens. Depending on input, the  following actions will take place:
.PP
If the command is a builtin, the Shell will  search the PATH variable for the directory containing the command.
.PP
If the search is  successful,  the shell executes the command.
.SH  ENVIRONMENT
When a program is invoked, it is given an array of strings called the environment.
.SH PROMPT
